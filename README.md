      Remote Cotrolled Car

In this project, I made a remote controlled car, via Bluetooth. I wanted to bring back to life an old toy car that I had
laying around. The main frame and overall the mechanical construction is already made, the main focus being on the
electrical system of the car.

The car is can be connected and controlled by an Android App that I developed using the MIT App Inventor online tool.
It has a simple, user friendly graphical interface, with a few commands. The car is able to use its turn signals when it
turns, and the back light are lighting up when the car is going in reverse. Sound can be played from the SD card that is
incorporated. The head lights go from small light intensity to maximum light intensity only in the dark, automatically.

The project is not finished, there are 3 things that has to be done: the audio amplifier has to be fixed, the transistors
are not working; the code for the microcontroller has to be done; the charger has to be made.
